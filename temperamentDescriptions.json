  "SanChlor": [
    "The strongest extrovert of all the blends of temperaments will be the SanChlor, for the two temperaments that make up his nature are both extroverted. The happy charisma of the sanguine makes him a people-oriented, enthusiastic, salesman type; but the choleric side of his nature will provide him with the necessary resolution and character traits that will fashion a somewhat more organized and productive individual than if he were pure sanguine. Almost any people-oriented field is open to him, but to sustain his interest it must offer variety, activity, and excitement.",
    "The potential weaknesses of a SanChlor are usually apparent to everyone because he is such an external person. He customarily talks too much, thus exposing himself and his weaknesses for all to see. He is highly opinionated. Consequently, he expresses himself loudly even before he knows all the facts. To be honest, no one has more mouth trouble! If he is the life of the party, he is lovable; but if he feels threatened or insecure, he can become obnoxious. His leading emotional problem will be anger, which can catapult him into action at the slightest provocation. Since he combines the easy forgetfulness of the sanguine and the stubborn casuistry of the choleric, he many not have a very active conscience. Consequently, he tends to justify his actions. This man, like any other temperament, needs to be filled daily with the Holy Spirit and the Word of God.",
    "Simon Peter, the self-appointed leader of the twelve apostles, is a classic example of a New Testament SanChlor. He obviously had mouth trouble, demonstrating this repeatedly by speaking up before anyone else could. He talked more in the Gospels than all the others put together - and most of what he said was wrong. He was egotistical, weak-willed, and carnal throughout the Gospels. In Acts, however, he was a remarkably transformed man - resolute, effective, and productive. What made the difference? He was filled with the Spirit."

  "SanMel": [
    "SanMels are highly emotional people who fluctuate drastically. They can laugh hysterically one minute and burst into tears the next. It is almost impossible for them to hear a sad tale, observe a tragic plight of another person, or listen to melancholic music without weeping profusely. They genuinely feel the grief's of others. Almost any field is open to them, especially public speaking, acting, music, and the fine arts. However, SanMels reflect an uninhibited perfectionism that often alienates them from others because they verbalize their criticisms. They are usually people-oriented individuals who have sufficient substance to make a contribution to other lives - if their ego and arrogance don't make them so obnoxious that others become hostile to them.",
    "One of the crucial weaknesses of this temperament blend prevails in SanMel's thought-life. Both sanguines and melancholies are dreamers, and thus if the melancholy part of his nature suggests a negative train of thought, it can nullify a SanMel's potential. It is easy for him to get down on himself. In addition, this person, more than most others, will have both an anger problem and a tendency toward fear. Both temperaments in his makeup suffer with an insecurity problem; not uncommonly, he is fearful to utilize his potential. Being admired by others is so important to him that it will drive him to a consistent level of performance. He has a great ability to commune with God, and if he walks in the Spirit he will make an effective sevant of Christ.",
    "King David is a classic illustration of the SanMel temperament. An extremely likable man who attracted both men and women; he was colorful, dramatic, emotional and weak-willed. He could play a harp and sing, he clearly demonstrated a poetic instinct in his Psalms, and he made decisions on impulse. Unfortunately, like many SanMels, he fouled up his life by a series of disastrous and costly mistakes before he gained enough self-discipline to finish out his destiny. All SanMels, of course, are not able to pick up the pieces of their lives and start over as David did. It is far better for them to walk in the Spriti daily and avoid such mistakes."
  ],
  "SanPhleg": [
    "The easiest person to like is a SanPhleg. The overpowering and obnoxious tendencies of a sanguine are offset by the gracious, easygoing phlegmatic. SanPhlegs are extremely happy people who carefree spirit and good humor make them lighthearted entertainers sought after by others. Helping people is their regular business, along with sales of various kinds. They are the least extroverted of any of the sanguines and are often regulated by their environment and circumstances rather than being self motivated. SanPhlegs are naturally pro-family and preserve the love of their children - and everyone else for that matter. They would not purposely hurt anyone.",
    "The SanPhleg's greatest weaknesses are lack of motivation and discipline. He would rather socialize than work, and he tends to take life too casually. As an executive remarked about one, \"He is the nicest guy I ever fired.\" He rarely gets upset over anything and tends to find the bright side of everything. He usually has an endless repertoire of jokes and delights in making others laugh, often when the occasion calls for seriousness. When Jesus Christ becomes the chief object of his love, he is transformed into a more resolute, purposeful, and productive person.",
    "The first-century evangelist Apollos is about as close as we can come to a New Testament illustration of the SanPhleg. A skilled orator who succeeded Paul and other who had founded the churches, he did the work of stirring the churches with his Spirit-filled preaching and teaching. Loved by all, followed devotedly by some, this pleasant and dedicated man apparently traveled a great deal but did not found new works."
  ],
  "ChlorSan": [
    "The second-strongest extrovert among the blends of temperament will be the reverse of the first - the ChlorSan. This man's life is given over completely to activity. Most of his efforts are productive and purposeful, but watch his recreation - it is so activity-prone that it borders being violent. He is a natural promoter and salesman, with enough charisma to get along well with others. Certainly the best motivator of people and one who thrives on a challenge, he is almost fearless and exhibits boundless energy. His wife will often comment, \"He has only two speeds, wide open and stop.\" Mr. ChlorSan is the courtroom attorney who can charm the coldest-hearted judge and jury, the fund-raiser who can get people to contribute what they intended to save, the man who never goes anywhere unnoticed, the preacher who combines both practical Bible teaching and church administration, and the politician who talks his state into changing its constitution so he can represent them one more time. A convincing debater, what he lacks in facts or arguments he makes up in bluff or bravado. As a teacher, he is an excellent communicator, particularly in the social sciences; rarely is he drawn to math, science, or the abstract. Whatever his professional occupation, his brain is always in motion.",
    "The weaknesses of this man, the chief of which is hostility, are as broad as his talents. He combines the quick, explosive anger of the sanguine (without the forgiveness) and the long-burning resentment of the choleric. He is the one personality type who not only gets ulcers himself, but gives them to others. Impatient with those who do not share his motivation and energy, he prides himself on being brutally frank (some call it sarcastically frank). It is difficult for him to concentrate on one thing very long, which is why he often enlists others to finish what he has started. He is opinionated, prejudiced, impetuous, and inclined doggedly to finish a project he probably should not have started in the first place. If not controlled by God, he is apt to justify anything he does - and rarely hesitates to manipulate or walk over other people to accomplish his ends. Most ChlorSans get so engrossed in their work that they neglect wife and family, even lashing out at them if they complain. Once he comprehends the importance of giving love and approval to his family, however, he can transform his entire household.",
    "James, the author of the biblical book that bears his name, could well have been a ChlorSan - at least his book sounds like it. The main thrust of the book declares that \"faith without works is dead\" - a favored concept of work-loving cholerics. He used the practical and logical reasoning of a choleric, yet was obviously a highly esteemed man of God. On human weakness he discusses - the fire of the tongue and how no man can control it (James 3) - relates directly to this temperament's most vulnerable characteristic, for we all know the ChlorSans feature a razor-sharp, active tongue. His victory and evident productiveness in the cause of Christ is a significant example to any thoughtful ChlorSan."
  ],
  "ChlorMel": [
    "The choleric/melancholy is an extremely industrious and capable person. The optimism and practicality of the choleric overcome the tendency toward moodiness of the melancholy, making the ChlorMel both goal-oriented and detailed. Such a person usually does well in school, possesses a quick, analytical mind, and yet is decisive. He develops into a thorough leader, the kind whom one can always count on to do an extraordinary job. Never take him on in a debate unless you are assured of your facts, for he will make mincemeat of you, combining verbal aggressiveness and attention to detail. This man is extremely competitive and forceful in all that he does. He is a dogged researcher and is usually successful, no matter what kind of business he pursues. This temperament probably makes the best natural leader. General George S. Patton, the great commander of the U.S. Third Army in World War II who drove the German forces back to Berlin, was probably a ChlorMel.",
    "Equally as great as his strengths, are his weaknesses. He is apt to be autocratic, a dictator type who inspires admiration and hate simultaneously. He is usually a quick-witted talker whose sarcasm can devastate others. He is a natural-born crusader whose work habits are irregular and long. A ChlorMel harbors considerable hostility and resentment, and unless he enjoys a good love relationship with his parents, he will find interpersonal relationships difficult, particularly with his family. No man is more apt to be an overly strict disciplinarian than the ChlorMel father. He combines the hard-to-please tendency of the choleric and the perfectionism of the melancholy. When controlled by the Holy Spirit, however, his entire emotional life is transformed and he makes an outstanding Christian.",
    "There is little doubt in my mind that the Apostle Paul was a ChlorMel. Before his conversion he was hostile and cruel, for the Scripture teaches that he spent his time persecuting and jailing Christians. Even after his conversion, his strong-willed determination turned to unreasonable bullheadedness, as when he went up to Jerusalem against the will and warning of God. His writings and ministry demonstrate the combination of the practical-analytical reasoning and the self-sacrificing but extremely driving nature of a ChlorMel. He is a good example of God's transforming power in the life of a ChlorMel who is completely dedicated to God's will."
  ],
  "ChlorPhleg": [
    "The most subdued of all the extrovert temperaments is the ChlorPhleg, a happy blend of the quick, active, and hot with the calm, cool, and unexcited. He is not as apt to rush into things as quickly as the preceding extroverts because he is more deliberate and subdued. He is extremely capable in the long run, although he does not particularly impress you that way at first. He is a very organized person who combines planning and hard work. People usually enjoy working with and for him because he knows where he is going and has charted his course, yet is not unduly severe with people. He has the ability to help others make the best use of theirs skills and rarely offends people or makes them feel used. The ChlorPhleg's slogan on organization states: \"Anything that needs to be done can be done better if it's organized.\" These men are usually good husbands and fathers as well as excellent administrators in almost any field.",
    "In spite of his obvious capabilities, the ChlorPhleg is not without a notable set of weaknesses. Although not as addicted to the quick anger of some temperaments, he is known to harbor resentment and bitterness. Some of the cutting edge of choleric's sarcasm is here offset by the gracious spirit of the phlegmatic; so instead of uttering cutting and cruel remarks, his barbs are more apt to emerge as cleverly disguised humor. One is never quite sure whether he is kidding or ridiculing, depending on his mood. No one can be more bull headedly stubborn that a ChlorPhleg, and it is very difficult for him to change his mind once it is committed. Repentance or the acknowledgment of a mistake is not at all easy for him. Consequently, he will be more apt to make it up to those he has wronged without really facing his mistake. The worrisome traits of the phlegmatic side of his nature may so curtail his adventurous tendencies that he never quite measures up to his capabilitites.",
    "Titus, the spiritual son of the Apostle Paul and leader of the hundred or so churches on the Isle of Crete, may well have been a ChlorPhleg. When filled with the Spirit, he was the kind of man on whom Paul could depend on to faithfully teach the Word to the churches and administrate them capably for the glory of God. The book which Paul wrote to him makes ideal reading for any teacher, particularly a ChlorPhleg."
  ],
  "MelSan": [
    "Mr. MelSan is usually a very gifted person, fully capable of being a musician who can steal the heart of an audience. As an artist, he not only draws or paints beautifully but can sell his own work- if he's in the right mood. It is not uncommon to encounter him in the field of education, for he makes a good scholar and probably the best of all classroom teachers, particularly on the high school and college level. The melancholy in him will ferret out little-known facts and be exacting in the use of events and detail, while the sanguine will enable him to communicate with students.",
    "Mr. MelSan shows an interesting combination of mood swings. Be sure of this: he is an emotional creature! When circumstances are pleasing to him, he can reflect a fantastically happy mood. But if things work out badly or he is rejected, insulted, or injured, he drops into such a mood that his lesser sanguine nature drowns in the resultant sea of self pity. He is easily moved to tears, feels everything deeply, but can be unreasonably critical and hard on others. He tends to be rigid and usually will not cooperate unless things go his way, which is often idealistic and impractical. He is often a fearful, insecure man with a poor self-image which liminits him unnecessarily.",
    "Many of the prophets were MelSans- John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah, and others. They had a tremendous capacity to commune with God, were self-sacrificing people-helpers who had enough charisma to attract a following, tended to be legalistic in their teachings and call to repentance, exhibited a flair for the dramatic, and willingly died for their principles."
  ],
  "MelChlor": [
    "The mood swings of the melancholy are usually stabilized by the MelChlor's self-will and determination. There is almost nothing vocationally which this man cannot do-and do well. He is both a perfectionist and a driver. He possesses strong leadership capabilities. Almost any craft, construction, or educational level is open to him. Unlike the MelSan, he may found his own institution or business and run it capably-not with noise and color but with efficiency. Many a great orchestra leader and choral condeuctor is a MelChlor.",
    "The natural weaknesses of MelChlors reveal themselves in the mind, emotions, and mouth. They are extremely difficult people to please, rarely satisfying even themselves. Once they start thinking negatively about something or someone (including themselves), they can be intolerable to live with. Their mood follows their thought process. Although they do not retain a depressed mood as long as the other blends of the melancholy, they can lapse into it more quickly. The two basic temperaments haunted by self-persecution, hostility, and criticism are the melancholy and the choleric. It is not uncommon for him to get angry at God as well as his fellowman, and if such thoughts persist long enough he may become manic-depressive. In extreme cases, he can become sadistic. When confronted with his vile thinking pattern and angry, bitter spirit, he can be expected to explode.",
    "His penchant for detailed analysis and perfection tends to make him a nitpicker who drives others up the wall. Unless he is filled with God's Spirit or can maintain a positive frame of mind, he is not enjoyable company for long periods of time. No one is more painfully aware of this than his wife and children. He not only 'emotes' disapproval, but feels compelled to castigate them verbally for their failures and to correct their mistakes-in public as well as private. This man, by nature, desperately needs the love of God in his heart, and his family needs him to share it with them.",
    "Many of the great men of the Bible show signs of a MelChlor temperament. Two that come to mind are Paul's tireless traveling companion, Dr. Luke, the painstaking scholar who carefully researched the life of Christ and left he church the most detailed account of our Lord's life, as well as the only record of the spread of the early church, and Moses, the great leader of Israel. Like many MelChlors, the latter never gained victory over his hostility and bitterness. Consequently, he died before his time. Like Moses, who wasted forty years on the backside of the desert, harboring bitterness and animosity before surrendering his life to God, many a MelChlor never lives up to his amazing potential because of the spirit of anger and revenge."
  ],
  "MelPhleg": [
    "Some of the greatest scholars the world has ever known have been MelPhlegs. They are not nearly as prone to hostility as the two previous melancholies and usually get along well with others. These gifted introverts combine the analytical perfectionism of the melancholy with the organized efficiency of the phlegmatic. They are usually good-natured humanitarians who prefer a quiet, solitary environment for study and research to the endless rounds of activities sought by the more extroverted temperaments. MelPhlegs are usually excellent spellers and good mathematicians. These gifted people have greatly benefited humanity. Most of the world's significant inventions and medical discoveries have been made by MelPhlegs.",
    "Despite his abilities, the MelPhleg, like the rest of us, has his own potential weaknesses. Unless controlled by God, he easily becomes discouraged and develops a very negative thinking pattern. But once he realizes it is a sin to develop the spirit of criticism and learns to rejoice, his entire outlook on life can be transformed. Ordinarily a quiet person, he is capable of inner angers and hostility caused by his tendency to be vengeful.",
    "MelPhlegs are unusually vulnerable to fear, anxiety, and a negative self-image. It has always amazed me that the people with the greatest talents and capabilities are often victimized by genuine feelings of poor self-worth. Their strong tendency to be conscientious allows them to let others pressure them into making commitments that drain their energy and creativity. When filled with God's spirit, these people are loved and admired by their family because their personal self-discipline and dedication are exemplary in the home. But humanitarian concerns cause them to neglect their family. Unless they learn to pace themselves and enjoy diversions that help them relax, they often become early mortality statistics.",
    "The most likely candidate for a MelPhleg in the Bible is the beloved Apostle John. He obviously had a very sensitive nature, for as a youth he laid his head on Jesus' breast at the Lord's Supper. On one occasion he became so angry at some people that he asked the Lord Jesus to call fire from heaven down on them. Yet at the crucifixion he was the one lone disciple who devotedly stood at the cross. John was the one to whom the dying Jesus entrusted his mother. Later the disciple became a great church leader and left us five books in the New Testament, two of which(the Gospel of John and the Book of Revelation) particularly glorify Jesus Christ."
