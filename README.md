# Temperament Test

## Inspiration
This repo is inspired by my Bible study class as we read Spirit-Filled Temperament by Tim LaHaye.  I found multiple websites with the Personality Temperament Test as a PDF, but nothing interactive.  I've taken the PDF and made a digital survey using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  I've used ChatGPT for basic structure and specific features.
